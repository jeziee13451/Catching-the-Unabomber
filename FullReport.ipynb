        "Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is the overlap of Computer Science and Linguistics that focuses on using computers to better understand human language. Language can be broken down into patterns – think sentence trees or conjugating verbs – and with those patterns, as well as statistical and machine learning modules, we can train computers to start “understanding” and analyzing human speech. Natural language processing is much more common than you may realize, as it is used for many voice recognition systems, such as voice activated GPS, robo-calls, online customer service chats, and virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa. One recent, fairly recognizable example of NLP is Chat GPT, which allows users to ask questions and have conversations with the AI Chat GPT. These conversations often sound impressively human. Using natural language processing, computers are able to process language similar to the way humans can. To do this, words and documents need to be broken down into smaller pieces computers can understand. This is called tokenization. There are many different types of tokenization, but we will be working specifically with sentence and word tokenization. Sentence tokenization takes a literary work and breaks it down by sentence. This is generally done by examining end punctuation. Word tokenization breaks down paragraphs or other written works by word, which is done by looking at where spaces appear."

        "NLP has many uses, but one of the most interesting uses we found for it is Forensic Linguistics. Forensic Linguistics is the overlap of forensic science – using science to gather evidence in criminal cases, like DNA or fingerprints – and linguistics. One part of forensic linguistics is proving authorship. A linguistic expert, or team of linguistic experts, is given writing by an unknown author as well as writings from a suspect or suspects. The experts then use aspects of the suspects’ writings and compare them to the aspects of the unknown author’s writing to see if they match. For example, they look for phrases common in certain geographic areas (like “Duck Duck Gray Duck” instead of “Duck Duck Goose”) or certain age groups. They can also look at the syntax of the authors to determine which “proper” English rules the authors break and how often they use different types of punctuation. They can even look for things as simple as spelling errors consistent between authors. \n",
        "\n",
        "We were interested in trying to mimic this while adding elements of probability and statistics. This would allow us opportunities to quantify how similar or different certain writings are. We could find basic statistics for different written works, such as mean sentence and word length, as well as finding the most frequently used words by authors. From these distributions, we were curious if we could create a way to determine authorship of a piece of writing with some degree of certainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we relied heavily on word and sentence tokenization in Python. We used the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, which has built-in tokenization functions. NLTK uses an algorithm similar to the Penn TreeBank Tokenization method, which is built off of white space tokenization. It has a large bank of information to tokenize, so it recognizes contractions, hyphenated words, and punctuation as singular tokens instead of breaking them up like white space tokenization would do. This allowed us to isolate words or punctuation, as well as finding the length of sentences and words. \n"

        "Forensic linguistics was used for the first time in the Unabomber FBI case ending in 1996. The FBI was unable to identify the unabomber without the help of forensic linguists due to the lack of physical evidence. The Unabomber evaded detection by law enforcement for 9 years, and then was only discovered through analysis of the 35,000 word manifesto published in both the New York Times and Washington Post in September of 1995. This manifesto was published to fulfill an ultimatum and stop the attacks and build a much stronger profile, and ended up leading to the capture of the Unabomber in April of 1996. It turns out that Kaczynski had a very specific writing style that resembled that of the 1950s, with lots of outdated word choices and eccentric grammar usage. Ultimately, Kaczynski’s brother David recognized the writing style from the published manifesto and turned in a writing sample from his brother. When going to arrest Ted Kaczynski, a judge was hesitant to sign a search warrant based solely on forensic linguistics, as this was basically all the evidence they had at the time, but ultimately signed the warrant to search Kaczynski's property and investigate him more thoroughly than they could without a warrant. This led to his arrest and sentence to life in prison.\n",

Knowing that the FBI used other metrics such as the syntax, regional language, bomb fragments, geographical profiling, and outdated language, we were not sure if this would be possible based on statistics alone, but wanted to see if we could provide a strong enough basis for a search warrant.

This meant we had to transcribe the 20-page document by hand, typing it up ourselves. The photocopy had a few words and phrases that were unreadable, which meant that our data is not perfect. In order to get the word counts to be correct, we used the name of our advisor, Shepanik, as a filler word because it was a word that didn't show up in the original documents. When finding common words, we added Shepanik to our filtered words (which were mainly overly common words such as articles and pronouns). \n",

We also looked at the distribution of punctuation, and had to clean our results to better compare them with the Unabomber Manifesto. Overall, we spent a lot of our time cleaning the files before doing any analysis on them."

This is called bootstrapping, and we can use it to create a 95% confidence interval. Bootstrapping is used when you have a population that is too small to find a precise variance. We will find the mean overlap percent and the range of values that a random manifesto's overlap percentage will fall within 95% of the time. From there, we can check to see if the overlap percentage of the Kaczynski letter is within that range. If not, we can reject the null hypothesis that the overlap percentage of the Kaczynski letter is random, and can conclude that there is a distinct possibility that he is also the author of the Unabomber Manifesto."

        "For each text, we gathered the top 20 most used \"long\" words, i.e., words of length ten or more letters, and compared how many of the words were shared between each manifesto and the Unabomber Manifesto. For example, the Fireside Chat and the Unabomber Manifesto only shared one frequent long word, \"government\". However, the piece of Kaczynski's writing submitted by his brother, which we labeled as Known Author, and the Unabomber Manifesto shared 8 out of the top 20 frequently used words, or 40%! Looking at the proportions, human instinct leads us to think this is a meaningful difference (40% vs. 5% or less in some cases). However, we essentially only have 13 pieces of data, the proportions of shared frequent words between each manifesto and the Unabomber Manifesto, and this is typically not enough to get a good estimate of the variance of this statistic; thus, the concern is that we don't really know how extreme 40% is and whether it could just be due to chance in a small sample. The bootstrap distribution gives us a way to quantify this. The only assumption needed is that you have a representative sample. If we assume that is the case, which we acknowledge is a big \"if\", we do see that 40% is a significant value and would only occur due to random sampling variance less than 5% of the time -- far less than that, in fact. So again, this indicates their overlap is not random, and points towards them having the same author!"

The colors for each of the punctuations hold constant, so we're just looking for the best \"pair\" of charts that match. The distributions of the other manifestos are distinctly different from both of them. We tried to prove this statistically using a logistic regression, but found that this does not work with our dataset, as we get a perfect separation error. This means that all or almost all of our predictors are associated with only one of the outcomes. We also attempted a chi-square test, but ran into similar issues, as the assumptions to use a chi-square test were violated."

One thing we tried was pulling out how many British vs. American spellings the author used. Based on the FBI report, this is one of the notable aspects of Kaczynski's writings that led to a further investigation into him. We attempted to replicate this in our code by using a list of British English spellings of words, but we couldn't get it to register correctly. Another thing we tried was using outdated terminology. This was another thing that the FBI linguists noticed was uncommon among the general public but showed up in both the Unabomber Manifesto and Kaczynski's letter. However, we couldn't figure out a system to pick out those kinds of phrases. In future projects, we would recommend looking into these further, potentially using more specific language models and n-grams to pick out specific phrases.\n",

We tried using word lengths in general, specifically the mean/maximum/minimum lengths, but they were all fairly close in all of the manifestos. Similarly, we tried using sentence lengths and ran into the same issue. We specifically picked manifestos to use as our tests because we didn't want to mistake similarities in form for similarities in authorship; for instance, mathematics journal articles would share certain characteristics with other mathematical journal articles just because of that form of writing. Since we can rule out similarities in form, we concluded that these statistics came from the similar forms of each of the manifestos.\n"

One specific feature we'd look into further is n-grams, which find the phrases of length n that are most used within a piece of writing. This could help us find some of the distinct phrases that the FBI pointed out as unique, like the phrase \"eat your cake and have it too.\" We would also look into using lemmatization to find common words that are used; lemmatization takes off the affixes of a word, leaving just the root word. This can be helpful in finding the topics of a piece of writing, as it counts words like \"helping\" and \"helped\" under the root word \"help.\" Finally, we would look into machine learning, such as the Naive Bayes model, to look for patterns that would be difficult to code.\n",

        "We had a couple weaknesses in our code that we would hopefully improve in further research. One weakness is having a small sample size, as we had only 12 manifestos other than the Unabomber Manifesto and the Kaczynski letter. This small of a sample size could lead to insignificant statistics seeming more significant than they are. Although we used bootstrapping in order to avoid that problem, we would use an even larger sample in the future. Our other biggest weakness is that we had to transcribe Kaczynski's letter ourselves based on an imperfect photocopy. This means there are missing words, and even though we tried to use a filler word, it could still affect sentence length. If we were to continue this research, we would hope to find a better quality copy of Kaczynski's letter to run our tests with."
